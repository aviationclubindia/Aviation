            <p>Being a pilot in India is great!</p>

                    <h3>Who Are We üßê</h3>
                    <p>"Aviation is proof that given the will, we have the capacity to achieve the impossible, so aviate, navigate and communicate" pondered one of our founding members as they stared at the contrails soaring high into the sky, truly representing how limitless dreams are. 

Dreaming- being the first step, was soon followed by the forming of a small group over whatsapp with fellow future Aviators amidst the pandemic in 2020, which soon prospered into a discord server currently acting as a melting point of aviation lovers all over the world, ready to fly high and take over their dreams!!</p>

                <div class="course-col">
                    <h3>Our Motive! ü§ùüèª</h3>
                    <p>We are a non profit organisation, whose sole motive is to make people believe in the inevitability of dreams and that passions may never die despite unavailability of resources! With near regular sessions, online flight simulations, an active group of aviation wanderers and quick trivias to keep everyone engaged and curious, we're incessantly pacing towards our dream, never looking back. Our core comittee mainly comprising of teenagers meticulously scavenges sources, scholarships, news updates and everything possible to help achieve this dream! May no stone remain unturned, and may finances and locations never be a hurdle!</p>

                    <h3>Welcome to the Fam!ü§ó</h3>
                    <p>We harp on the words, that Age can never be a barrier or the end to one's dreams. As life always finds a way, the heartwarming words of one such member remains engraved in our minds, fuelling us to never give up - "I always wished to be a Pilot. I'm over 40 years now, and even though I couldn't pursue aviation, I got into a career which allows me to traverse the skies, travel places and explore these beloved aircrafts. The inner child in me smiles thinking of these wonders, each and every time, as my love for aviation keeps burning brighter"

On that note, YES, the only criteria (apart from one's love for aviation of course!) to being a part of this family of 40 members is the yearning to keep learning, relentlessly! With young students to CPL students and adults of other professions, we have them all, from all over the world, unified in this server, willing to share every bit of experience, stories, knowledge and what not, which undeniably is the best way to keep learning, as one by one the drops of knowledge gather to cover the whole ocean-esque and farther than sky discoveries of Aviation! 

As you found us, we believe that you've taken the first step, so come on Passenger, We welcome you with warm hugs, we won't leave without you!</p>
